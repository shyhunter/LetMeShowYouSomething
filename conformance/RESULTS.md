# Recorded runs

Each row is one fresh agent, one fixture, set up with `run.mjs setup` and given exactly its prompt. The
machine columns come from `run.mjs score`. The rubric was scored by the maintainer agent (Claude),
not by a person, so it is provisional until the owner confirms it.

| fixture | machine | rubric | missed |
|---|---|---|---|
| handoff | 3/3 | 2/3 | did not tell the reviewer that exporting sends nothing by itself |
| renderer-fails | 2/2 | 3/3 | |
| returned-page | 2/2 | 3/3 | |
| couldnt-test | 1/1 | 2/2 | |
| proposal-outcomes | 2/2 | 2/3 | did not say the page does not show outcomes yet (#94) |

**Not tested:** Codex, Gemini, Hermes and every other agent or host. A fixture with no row for an
agent is not a pass for it.
